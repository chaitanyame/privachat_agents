# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation and planning files that are no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## Directory Structure

### `technical-reviews/`
Historical technical review documents from the MVP development phase (circa November 2025).

**Archived files:**
- `TECHNICAL_REVIEW_MVP_VS_PERPLEXICA.md` - Comparison of MVP vs original Perplexica
- `SIDE_BY_SIDE_CODE_COMPARISON.md` - Code comparison analysis
- `CRITICAL_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of fixes applied during MVP phase
- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_TECHNICAL_REVIEW.md` - Executive summary of technical review
- `TECHNICAL_REVIEW_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Improvement tracking document
- `PROMPT_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Prompt improvement summary
- `QUICK_REFERENCE_MISSING_FEATURES.md` - Missing features checklist
- `EXHAUSTIVE_SEARCH_PLAN.md` - Planning doc for scheduled searches

**Reason for archival:** These documents compared the old `services/` MVP implementation with the original Perplexica. The new `research-service/` implementation supersedes this analysis.

**Current documentation:** See `research-service/docs/` and `research-service/ROADMAP.md` for active development status.

**Archived files:**
- `plan.md` - 630-line feasibility analysis and architecture planning from early development
