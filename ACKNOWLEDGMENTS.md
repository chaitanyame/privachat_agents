## Inspiration and Attribution

PrivaChat Agents is inspired by and builds upon concepts from **[Perplexica](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica)** by [ItzCrazyKns](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns).

We are grateful for the innovative work on AI-powered search and research systems that Perplexica pioneered. While PrivaChat Agents is a complete rewrite with a different architecture (Pydantic AI agents vs. LangChain), we acknowledge the inspiration and ideas that came from studying the Perplexica project.
