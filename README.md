│   ┌──────────────────────────────┐  │### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

│   │  Redis Cache Layer           │  │

│   │  • Embedding cache (7d TTL)  │  │Perplexica can be easily run using Docker. Simply run the following command:

│   │  • Response cache (1d TTL)   │  │

│   │  • 4.6x faster cached queries│  │```bash

│   └──────────────────────────────┘  │docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v perplexica-data:/home/perplexica/data -v perplexica-uploads:/home/perplexica/uploads --name perplexica itzcrazykns1337/perplexica:latest

│   ┌──────────────────────────────┐  │```

│   │  OpenRouter Integration      │  │

│   │  • PydanticAI agents         │  │This will pull and start the Perplexica container with the bundled SearxNG search engine. Once running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You can then configure your settings (API keys, models, etc.) directly in the setup screen.

│   │  • Async embeddings          │  │

│   │  • Connection pooling        │  │**Note**: The image includes both Perplexica and SearxNG, so no additional setup is required. The `-v` flags create persistent volumes for your data and uploaded files.

│   └──────────────────────────────┘  │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘#### Using Perplexica with Your Own SearxNG Instance

       │               │

       ▼               ▼If you already have SearxNG running, you can use the slim version of Perplexica:

┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐

│  SearxNG    │ │   Redis     │```bash

│  Port 8080  │ │  Port 6379  │docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e SEARXNG_API_URL=http://your-searxng-url:8080 -v perplexica-data:/home/perplexica/data -v perplexica-uploads:/home/perplexica/uploads --name perplexica itzcrazykns1337/perplexica:slim-latest

└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘```

```

**Important**: Make sure your SearxNG instance has:

**Performance Metrics:**

- First query (cold): ~5s- JSON format enabled in the settings

- Cached query: ~1s (4.6x faster)- Wolfram Alpha search engine enabled

- Quality mode: <6s with URL enrichment

- URL fetching: 3x faster with async processingReplace `http://your-searxng-url:8080` with your actual SearxNG URL. Then configure your AI provider settings in the setup screen at http://localhost:3000.

    "optimizationMode": "quality"If you're encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama's API. To fix this issue you can:

  }'

```1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.

2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

### Response Format

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`

```json   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`

{   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:11434`

  "answer": "Detailed answer with citations...",

  "sources": [   Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.

    {

      "title": "Article Title",3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

      "url": "https://example.com/article",

      "content": "Snippet or full content..."   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"`. (Change the port number if you are using a different one.) Then reload the systemd manager configuration with `systemctl daemon-reload`, and restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

    }

  ]   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

}

```#### Lemonade Connection Errors



### Focus ModesIf you're encountering a Lemonade connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Lemonade's API. To fix this issue you can:



- `webSearch` - General web search1. **Check your Lemonade API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.

- `academicSearch` - Academic papers and research2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

docker compose build api
docker compose up -d api
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Cache Statistics
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cache/stats
```

### Container Status
```bash
docker compose ps
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### API returns empty responses
- Check OpenRouter API key is set correctly
- Verify SerperDev API key is valid (or disable it)
- Check logs: `docker compose logs api`

### Cache not working
- Verify Redis is running: `docker compose ps redis`
- Check Redis connection: `docker exec simple_perplexica-redis-1 redis-cli PING`
- Review cache logs: `docker compose logs api | grep cache`

### Slow responses
- Check if caching is enabled (`REDIS_ENABLED=true`)
- Verify async URL fetching is working (logs should show "Concurrent URL fetching")
- Monitor Redis: `docker stats simple_perplexica-redis-1`

### SearxNG errors
- Ensure SearxNG is running: `curl http://localhost:8080`
- Check SearxNG logs: `docker compose logs searxng`
- Verify configuration in `searxng/settings.yml`
