This unit aims to help clients move beyond basic cloud migration to achieve complete infrastructure and application modernization, including operational automation and AI integration. The BU utilizes proven frameworks, AWS-native solutions, and specialized AWS-certified consultants and engineers. Key accelerators include SoftServe's Adaptive Modernization Platform (SAMP) and AI-Driven Enhanced Engineering with Q (AIDEEQ). This initiative is designed to shorten modernization timelines from years to months, reduce risk, and deliver tangible results, with clients potentially achieving up to five times faster time-to-market for new features and services and reducing cloud infrastructure costs by up to 30% [1]. The BU focuses on four pillars: igniting innovation at the edge, concentrating on high-impact outcomes, accelerating solution success at scale, and executing with precision and accountability [1]. They leverage AWS-native services such as Transform, Amazon Q, and Bedrock Agents, along with SAMP and AIDEEQ, to reduce modernization timelines by up to 75%, transforming multi-year projects into 4–6-month delivery cycles [1]. SoftServe's AI-powered migration factory further streamlines this process [1]. SoftServe is an AWS Premier Tier Services Partner with 12 AWS competencies and six industry competencies, and is an inaugural launch partner of the AWS Generative AI Competency and Data Foundation for Generative AI with AWS [1]. SoftServe will be attending AWS re:Invent 2025 in Las Vegas, December 1-5, 2025 [1].\n\n*   **APT Quantum Computer Available on AWS Braket:** Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT) has made its 12-qubit IBEX Q1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessible through Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Braket service [3].
